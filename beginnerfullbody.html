            <h2>Workout Description</h2>
            <p>Do this full body split 3 times a week. The goal is to get your form down pat on the most basic and most important exercises in the gym. Go to the exercise section here at Muscle & Strength and look up the exercises if you are unsure about them. Each exercise is linked to videos which can help you with your form.</p>
            <p>When you move the weight, I want you to count: 1-2 both up and down on the movement. For example: if you're curling, I want you to count 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand while you bring the dumbbell up, then 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand while you bring it back down. I don't want you to go heavy on these, just enough resistance so by the third set you are barely finishing your maximum rep count. Focus on making your reps as perfect as possible and as identical as possible. Form is way more important than weight, especially at this stage of the game.</p>
            <p>Don't get discouraged. No matter how big any of the guys are at the gym, they all started somewhere. Some of them probably started with lighter weights than you did.</p>
