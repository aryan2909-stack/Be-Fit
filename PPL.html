            <h2>Workout Description</h2>
            <p>If you’re new to working out and are driven to make yourself bigger, leaner, or stronger, then you want to channel that passion and energy in the right direction. This 3-day push, pull, legs (PPL) routine will get you started on the right foot. You will learn the ropes of serious training while improving every week for the next 10 weeks. </p>
            <p>There are three key benefits to utilizing a PPL routine, especially for beginners. First and foremost, you will learn how to train for a purpose and figure out how those corresponding muscle groups work together and on their own. </p>
            <p>Second, PPL routines are simple to follow but provide the necessary challenges to push yourself. You will likely see benefits sooner because you can execute the workouts with minimal trouble. Additionally, most gyms are set up so you can stay in a certain area while performing the workouts..</p>
            <p>Last but not least, you are more likely to see strength increases because PPL-style workouts focus on strength and improving muscle size. You won’t isolate each area as in a traditional single-body part routine. Those are great for when you advance, but PPL is great for laying a solid foundation.</p>

            <h2>Workout Overview</h2>
            <p>This is going to be a three-day program. You will train for Push on Day 1, Pull on Day 2, and Legs on Day 3. Beginners should take a day off between each workout to focus on recovery and preparing for the next training session. I understand that as a beginner, you may have a lot of enthusiasm and believe the myth that more is better. </p>
            <p>Eventually, you may need to add more volume to a program like this or choose something different. But for now, this will be enough for you to see benefits, improve in the ways you want to, and minimize the risk of injury as long as you train safely with a spotter. Even though you’re a beginner, these exercises are chosen so you get the most bang for your buck. If you insist on changing an exercise from one to another, you can go to our Exercises section to find a replacement.</p>
